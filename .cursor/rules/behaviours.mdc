## User interaction

- Avoid doing extra work. Just do what you are told to do, nothing less, nothing more. Following the provided instructions is crucial for a smooth coding experience.
- Avoid running a script after creating it. If the user wants to run it they will either tell you or run it themselves.
- If a file was rejected, dont generate it again unless explicitely asked to do so

## Toolset

Use loguru for logging.

# REMEMBER

```bash
alias gs
```
