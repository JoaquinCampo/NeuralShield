## Final Results

| Method          | Preprocessing | Recall @ 5% FPR | Precision  | F1         | vs IsolationForest |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| IsolationForest | Yes           | 27-28%          | ~81%       | ~42%       | Baseline           |
| **Mahalanobis** | **Yes**       | **39.96%**      | **88.90%** | **55.13%** | **+43%**           |
| Mahalanobis     | No            | 29.45%          | 85.52%     | 43.81%     | +7%                |
| IsolationForest | No            | 13.81%          | ~76%       | ~24%       | Reference          |

## Key Findings

### 1. Mahalanobis Wins

- **40% recall @ 5% FPR** with preprocessing (hit "Good" target)
- Better precision than IsolationForest (89% vs 81%)
- Significantly better F1-score (55% vs 42%)

### 2. Fast and Stable

- Training: <1 second (vs minutes for IsolationForest hyperparameter search)
- Inference: ~5 seconds for 50k samples
- Zero numerical issues (vs EllipticEnvelope failures)
- Zero hyperparameters to tune

### 3. Preprocessing Still Critical

- With preprocessing: 39.96% recall
- Without preprocessing: 29.45% recall
- **+36% improvement** from preprocessing

### 4. Why It Works

Mahalanobis accounts for feature correlations in embeddings:

- BGE-small produces correlated features
- IsolationForest treats dimensions independently
- Covariance-aware scoring captures attack patterns better

## Recommendations

### For Production

**Use Mahalanobis + BGE-small + Preprocessing:**

- 40% recall @ 5% FPR
- Sub-second inference
- Simpler than IsolationForest (no hyperparameter tuning)
- More interpretable (statistical distance)

### Next Steps

1. **Test on ByT5 embeddings** - May now leverage byte-level features (2944 dims)
2. **Ensemble approach** - Combine Mahalanobis + rule-based detectors
3. **Threshold calibration** - Per-endpoint thresholds for different risk profiles

## Conclusion

**Hypothesis confirmed:** Accounting for feature correlations significantly improves anomaly detection on dense embeddings.

Mahalanobis is the new production winner:

- Simple
- Fast
- Better performance
- More interpretable
