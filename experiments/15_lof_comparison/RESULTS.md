## Experiment 1: LOF on SecBERT Embeddings

**Goal**: Test if local density helps on dense semantic embeddings

### Setup

- Model: SecBERT (768 dimensions)
- Preprocessing: Yes
- Detector: LOF with varying k
- Dataset: CSIC (47K train, 50K test)

### Results

| k   | Recall @ 5% FPR | Precision | F1     |
| --- | --------------- | --------- | ------ |
| 5   | 46.23%          | 90.26%    | 61.14% |
| 10  | 45.84%          | 90.19%    | 60.78% |
| 15  | 45.63%          | 90.15%    | 60.59% |
| 25  | 45.59%          | 90.14%    | 60.56% |
| 35  | 45.37%          | 90.10%    | 60.35% |
| 50  | 45.13%          | 90.05%    | 60.13% |
| 100 | 43.46%          | 89.71%    | 58.55% |

**vs Mahalanobis baseline: 49.26%**

### Analysis

**LOF underperforms on SecBERT (-3.03pp vs Mahalanobis)**

**Why:**

- SecBERT creates semantically homogeneous embeddings
- Preprocessing + domain pretraining → one cohesive "normal HTTP" space
- Global covariance captures the structure better than local density
- 768D suffers from distance concentration for k-NN methods

**Optimal k: 5-10** (very small neighborhoods)

- Performance degrades monotonically with larger k
- Suggests weak local structure

---

## Experiment 2: LOF on TF-IDF + PCA Embeddings

**Goal**: Test if local density helps on sparse syntactic embeddings

### Setup

- Model: TF-IDF (5000 features) + PCA (150 dimensions)
- Preprocessing: Yes
- Detector: LOF with varying k
- Dataset: CSIC (47K train, 50K test)

### Results

| k       | Recall @ 5% FPR | Precision  | F1         |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 5       | 56.77%          | 92.09%     | 70.24%     |
| 10      | 54.53%          | 92.08%     | 68.50%     |
| 20      | 60.05%          | 92.66%     | 72.88%     |
| 30      | 61.36%          | 93.88%     | 74.21%     |
| 50      | 60.48%          | 93.19%     | 73.36%     |
| **100** | **61.84%**      | **93.08%** | **74.31%** |

**vs Mahalanobis baseline: 10.52%**

### Analysis

**LOF dominates on TF-IDF (+51.32pp vs Mahalanobis, 6x improvement!)**

**Why:**

- TF-IDF creates multimodal, syntactically diverse embeddings
- Different endpoint types form distinct local clusters
- LOF adapts to local density variations
- Mahalanobis assumes one Gaussian → fails on sparse, multimodal data

**Optimal k: 100** (moderate neighborhoods)

- Stable performance in k=30-100 range
- Larger neighborhoods than SecBERT (100 vs 5)
- Suggests stronger local cluster structure

**PCA sweet spot: 150 dimensions**

- Captures 96.95% variance
- Low enough for meaningful k-NN
- High enough to preserve signal

## Experiment 3: Impact of Preprocessing on LOF

**Goal**: Measure how preprocessing affects LOF detection on TF-IDF

### Setup

- Model: TF-IDF (5000 features) + PCA (150 dimensions)
- Detector: LOF (k=100)
- Variants: With vs Without preprocessing

### Results

| Variant              | Recall @ 5% FPR | Precision | F1      | PCA Variance |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| **No Preprocessing** | **64.20%**      | 92.95%    | 75.95%  | 93.01%       |
| With Preprocessing   | 61.84%          | 93.08%    | 74.31%  | 96.95%       |
| **Difference**       | **+2.36pp**     | -0.13pp   | +1.64pp | -3.94pp      |

### Detailed Comparison

**Agreement: 94.5%** (models agree on most examples)

**Unique Catches:**

- No-prep catches: **1,151 attacks** (encoding-based)
- With-prep catches: **560 attacks** (noise-obscured)
- **Net advantage: +591 attacks for no-prep**

**Universally caught: 14,941 attacks**
**Universally missed: 8,413 attacks**

### Analysis

**Preprocessing HURTS syntactic detection (-2.36pp)**

**Why no-preprocessing wins:**

1. **Encoding variations preserved**

   - `../` vs `%2e%2e%2f` vs `..%2f` → different TF-IDF tokens
   - Each encoding trick forms distinct local cluster
   - LOF catches density anomalies in each variant

2. **Attack diversity maintained**

   - Preprocessing homogenizes attacks
   - Normalization makes variants look similar
   - Reduces attack signal in embedding space

3. **TF-IDF is syntactic, not semantic**
   - Benefits from surface-level variations
   - Doesn't need semantic normalization
   - Preserves attack fingerprints

**Attacks caught by no-prep only:**

- Percent-encoded path traversal variants
- Mixed-case header exploits
- Unicode encoding tricks
- Special character variations

**Attacks caught by with-prep only:**

- Attacks hidden in whitespace noise
- Obs-fold header exploits
- Complex URL structure attacks

## Experiment 4: LOF vs SecBERT Complementarity

**Goal**: Analyze what attacks each model catches uniquely

### Setup

- Model 1: LOF + TF-IDF + PCA (no preprocessing)
- Model 2: SecBERT + Mahalanobis (with preprocessing)
- Compare predictions on same test set

### Results

**Agreement: 71.0%** (29% of cases decided differently)

**Detection Breakdown:**

- Universally caught: 7,869 attacks (31.4%)
- LOF unique: 7,632 attacks (30.5%)
- SecBERT unique: 4,478 attacks (17.9%)
- Universally missed: 5,086 attacks (20.3%)

**Total Detections:**

- LOF: 15,501 attacks (61.84% recall)
- SecBERT: 12,347 attacks (49.26% recall)

**False Positives:**

- Shared FPs: 9 examples (minimal overlap)
- Unique FPs: 2,384 examples
- Different failure modes

### Analysis

**Models are highly complementary**

**LOF catches 70% more unique attacks than SecBERT (7,632 vs 4,478)**

**LOF strengths (syntactic attacks):**

- Path traversal patterns
- SQL injection syntax
- Encoding tricks and variations
- Token-level anomalies
- Structural exploits

**SecBERT strengths (semantic attacks):**

- Context-dependent exploits
- Business logic attacks
- Semantically malicious but syntactically normal
- Domain-specific attack patterns

**Potential ensemble recall: ~79.7%**

- Combined: 7,869 + 7,632 + 4,478 = 19,979 attacks
- Total attacks: 25,065
- Improvement: +18pp over LOF, +30pp over SecBERT

## Key Insights

### 1. Embedding Structure Determines Detector Choice

| Embedding Type | Structure                     | Best Detector   | Why                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **TF-IDF**     | Sparse, multimodal, syntactic | **LOF**         | Captures local cluster variations        |
| **SecBERT**    | Dense, unimodal, semantic     | **Mahalanobis** | Global covariance fits homogeneous space |

**Rule**: Sparse/multimodal → LOF, Dense/unimodal → Mahalanobis

### 2. Preprocessing Impact Depends on Embedding Type

| Embedding              | Preprocessing Impact | Reason                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Semantic (SecBERT)** | **+13% recall**      | Removes noise, clarifies intent  |
| **Syntactic (TF-IDF)** | **-2.4% recall**     | Removes signal, hides variations |

**Rule**: Semantic models benefit from preprocessing, syntactic models don't

### 3. Local vs Global Density

**When LOF wins:**

- Multimodal distributions (multiple clusters)
- Syntactic/structural patterns
- Sparse embeddings with clear local structure
- Different cluster densities

**When Mahalanobis wins:**

- Dense embeddings with global structure
- Homogeneous feature correlations

### 4. Optimal Hyperparameters

**LOF on TF-IDF:**

- k=100 (moderate neighborhoods)
- PCA dimensions: 150 (93-97% variance)
- No preprocessing

**LOF on SecBERT:**

- k=5-10 (very small neighborhoods)
- Full 768 dimensions
- With preprocessing

### 5. Complementary Detection

**LOF and SecBERT catch different attack types:**

- 29% disagreement rate
- Minimal FP overlap (9 shared)
- Ensemble potential: ~80% recall

**Total improvement: 0.96% → 64.20% (+63.24pp, 67x better)**

### Why LOF Succeeds Where Others Failed

**Previous TF-IDF attempts:**

- Exp 01: TF-IDF + IsolationForest = 0.96% (failed)
- Exp 10: TF-IDF + PCA + Mahalanobis = 10.52% (failed)

**What changed:**

- **PCA dimensionality**: 150 vs 300 (better for k-NN)
- **Detector**: LOF vs IsolationForest/Mahalanobis (local vs global)
- **No preprocessing**: Preserves attack diversity

**Key insight**: TF-IDF isn't bad, it just needs the right detector (LOF) and right dimensionality (150).
