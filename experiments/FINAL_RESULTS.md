## Experiment Details

### Experiment 01: TF-IDF (Baseline)

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Location**: `experiments/01_tfidf_preprocessing_comparison/`

- **Sparse word-level embeddings**
- **Recall**: 0.96% @ ~5% FPR
- **Conclusion**: Insufficient for production use

### Experiment 02: BGE-small Dense Embeddings

**Status**: ✅ Complete (WINNER)  
**Location**: `experiments/02_dense_embeddings_comparison/`

**Without Preprocessing:**

- Recall: 13.81% @ ~5% FPR
- Precision: ~73%

**With Preprocessing:**

- Recall: 27-28% @ ~5% FPR
- Precision: ~80%
- **Improvement**: +96% recall gain

**Key Insights:**

- Preprocessing nearly doubles performance
- 384 dimensions is optimal for IsolationForest
- Best balance of simplicity and effectiveness

### Experiment 03: SecBERT (Domain-Specific)

**Status**: ⏸️ Not Completed  
**Location**: `experiments/03_secbert_comparison/`

- Cybersecurity-focused BERT variant
- 768 dimensions
- Not tested due to time constraints

### Experiment 04: ColBERT + MUVERA (Multi-Vector)

**Status**: ✅ Complete (FAILED)  
**Location**: `experiments/04_colbert_muvera_comparison/`

**Results:**

- Recall: 93.06%
- **FPR: 92.73%** ← Unacceptable!
- Flags 93% of normal traffic as attacks

**Why it failed:**

- **Curse of dimensionality**: 10,240 dims too high
- IsolationForest cannot handle such high dimensions
- All points appear equidistant in 10k-dimensional space

**Conclusion**: Multi-vector embeddings are incompatible with IsolationForest

### Experiment 05: ByT5 (Byte-Level)

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Location**: `experiments/05_byt5_comparison/`

**Without Preprocessing:**

- Recall: 14.36% @ 5.37% FPR
- Precision: 72.83%

**With Preprocessing:**

- Recall: 20.63% @ 4.83% FPR
- Precision: 81.07%
- **Improvement**: +43% recall gain

**Hypothesis Testing:**

- **Tested**: Byte-level tokenization > Word-piece for HTTP
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - Word-piece (BGE) still wins

**Why byte-level didn't win:**

- HTTP attacks are semantic, not byte-level
- SQL injection (`OR 1=1`) is about meaning, not characters
- 2944 dims may be suboptimal middle ground
- IsolationForest doesn't leverage fine-grained distinctions

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Dimensionality is Critical

**Optimal Range**: 300-1000 dimensions for IsolationForest

- **Too Low** (5000 sparse): Poor semantic understanding (0.96% recall)
- **Sweet Spot** (384 dense): Best performance (27-28% recall)
- **Middle** (2944): Good but not optimal (20.63% recall)
- **Too High** (10,240): Complete failure (92.73% FPR)

### 2. Preprocessing is Essential

All models improved with preprocessing:

- **BGE-small**: +96% improvement (13.81% → 27-28%)
- **ByT5**: +43% improvement (14.36% → 20.63%)

**Preprocessing pipeline:**

- Lowercase normalization
- URL decoding
- Whitespace normalization
- Special character handling

### 3. Semantic Understanding > Fine-Grained Features

- **Word-piece tokenization (BGE)** captures semantic patterns better
- **Byte-level tokenization (ByT5)** doesn't provide expected advantage
- HTTP attack detection is fundamentally a semantic task

### 4. IsolationForest Has Dimensionality Limits

- Works best with **< 1000 dimensions**
- Struggles with **> 3000 dimensions**
- Fails catastrophically with **> 5000 dimensions**

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **Use BGE-small with preprocessing**

   - Model: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
   - Preprocessing: Enable full pipeline
   - Expected: 27-28% recall @ 5% FPR

2. **Configuration**

   ```python
   encoder = FastEmbedEncoder(
       model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5",
       device="cuda"  # or "cpu"
   )

   detector = IsolationForestDetector(
       contamination=0.05,
       n_estimators=200,
       max_samples="auto",
       random_state=42
   )
   ```

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track FPR in production (target: < 5%)
   - Adjust contamination parameter if needed
   - Retrain periodically with new data

### For Future Research

1. **Try SecBERT** (domain-specific, untested)
2. **Neural network anomaly detectors** for high-dimensional embeddings
3. **Ensemble approaches** combining multiple models
4. **PCA dimensionality reduction** before IsolationForest
5. **Different datasets** with more byte-level exploits

### What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Don't use ColBERT or multi-vector embeddings with IsolationForest
2. ❌ Don't exceed 3000 dimensions without testing
3. ❌ Don't skip preprocessing
4. ❌ Don't use TF-IDF for production (0.96% recall)

## Conclusion

After comprehensive testing, **BGE-small with preprocessing** is the recommended solution for HTTP anomaly detection with IsolationForest, achieving **27-28% recall at ~5% FPR**.

While this recall rate is modest, it represents a **28x improvement over the TF-IDF baseline** and balances false positives with attack detection effectively.

Future work should explore:

- Neural network anomaly detectors for better recall
- Ensemble methods combining multiple embeddings
- Semi-supervised approaches with labeled attack data
